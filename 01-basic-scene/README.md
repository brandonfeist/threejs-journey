# Lesson 1: Basic Scene
This lesson explores the most basic ThreeJs functionalities. We explore setting up a basic scene with a camera and a red cube, then render it to a static 800x600px canvas.

## Dependencies
Do to the nature of this scene being so basic, we simply download the ThreeJs min file and import it from the dependencies folder at: `~/dependencies/three.min.js`.
