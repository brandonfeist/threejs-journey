# Lesson 11: 3D Text
This lesson took a dive into the `TextGeometry` and its ability to use typeface fonts to create 3D text. As well as using the bounding box calculations to calculate local position and optimizing creating a huge ammount of assets by re-using things such as `geometries` and `materials`.

## Lesson Results
3D text saying `HeySkylark` surrounded by 1000 random dougnuts.
