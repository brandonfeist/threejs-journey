# Lesson 3: Transformations and Groups
A lesson on transformations and grouping in ThreeJs.

## Lesson Results
In this lesson I learned about transformation vectors which are used for position, scale, and rotatio, the importance of rotation order, and how to group objects into a single 3D object group. Lastly, utility functions such as `lookAt` which is useful to have objects point to another vector coordinate.
