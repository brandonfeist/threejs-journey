# ThreeJs Journey
I will be going through Bruno Simon's [ThreeJs Journey](https://threejs-journey.com) and documenting my steps along the way. I have spent some time in the past dabbling in ThreeJs, but never had a chance to fully immerse myself in the framework.

# What I Hope to Achieve
I feel that with the exponentially increasing power of mobile devices, 3D on the web will continue to become more important in creating new experiences that not too long ago were not possible.
